# ðŸ“± Digital Phenotyping Data Collection

This repository hosts tools, documentation, and sample datasets for the collection of **digital phenotyping data**. Digital phenotyping involves the continuous, real-time measurement of human behavior and health using data from personal digital devices, such as smartphones and wearables.

## ðŸ§  What is Digital Phenotyping?

Digital phenotyping refers to the moment-by-moment quantification of the individual-level human phenotype using data from digital devices. This includes behavioral, social, mobility, physiological, and environmental signals.

Common data types:
- Accelerometer and gyroscope data
- GPS/location tracking
- Phone usage patterns (calls, screen time, etc.)
- Typing dynamics
- Sleep and activity logs
